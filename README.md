### Hi everyone

I'm Fime, I'm french and I like programmation, video games, space engeniering and music.
I don't really know other languages than the Python, but I'm pretty motivated to learn the C/C++ wich are very important languages (I guess).

You can contact me on Discord as `Fime#9701` !

I wrote some games (and other scripts) in python for the Numworks calculator : [profile link on the workshop]https://workshop.numworks.com/python/fime)

Current goal : contribute to the Omega Numworks OS.
